1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,019
<i>Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China</i>

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,146
<i>than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,023
<i>- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.</i>

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,149
<i>What would account for that?</i>

5
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,235
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,446
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,364
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,241
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,452
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,995
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,913
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,206
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,584
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,918
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,336
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,838
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,798
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,924
This is serious.

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,468
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,428
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,096
I was kidding.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,347
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,224
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,143
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,479
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,522
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,149
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,151
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,277
No.

30
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,446
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,989
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,115
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,203
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,788
Okay.

35
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,331
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,208
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,711
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,671
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,634
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,054
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,222
Which one?

42
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,807
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,642
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,062
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,605
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,399
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,026
Okay, well,
which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,406
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,659
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,662
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,080
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,124
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,460
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,879
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,173
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,341
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,218
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,553
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,972
I... What?

60
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,598
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,184
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,770
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,021
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,690
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,233
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,903
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,364
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,783
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,244
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,996
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,582
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,376
Final clubs.
Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,172
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,091
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,843
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,178
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,013
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,931
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,766
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,269
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,937
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,939
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,275
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,737
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you, you can be?

85
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,363
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,948
I was kidding.

87
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,700
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,868
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,204
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,874
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,127
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,713
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,757
We're dating.

94
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,217
Okay.

95
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,470
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,388
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,974
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,143
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,228
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,562
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,314
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,233
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,567
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,486
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,321
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,076
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,580
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,166
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,502
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,920
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,005
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,423
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,759
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,095
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,429
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,432
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,685
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,936
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,188
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,356
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,774
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,192
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,111
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,656
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,201
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,203
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,039
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,207
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,458
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,627
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,297
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,051
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,138
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,889
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,560
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,689
It'll be because you're an asshole.

137
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,789
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

138
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,417
<i>Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,</i>

139
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,754
<i>or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?</i>

140
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,135
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C,</i>

141
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,888
<i>but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

142
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:39,059
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.</i>

143
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,898
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

144
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,275
<i>I need to do something
to take my mind off her.</i>

145
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,945
<i>Easy enough, except I need an idea.</i>

146
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,245
<i>I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

147
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,247
<i>So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
And it's a Tuesday night?</i>

148
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,373
Billy.

149
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,208
<i>The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,</i>

150
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,961
<i>and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

151
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,631
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

152
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,968
<i>next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

153
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,636
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson.</i>

154
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,020
<i>Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

155
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,939
<i>but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.</i>

156
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,524
<i>It gives the whole thing
a very "Turing" feel</i>

157
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,568
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit</i>

158
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,195
<i>than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,</i>

159
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,989
<i>like they do on hotornot.com.</i>

160
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,616
<i>The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.</i>

161
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,910
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,</i>

162
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,036
<i>so I'm going to have to get all the images</i>

163
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,788
<i>from the individual houses
that people are in.</i>

164
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,624
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

165
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,683
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

166
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,769
<i>They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.</i>

167
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,399
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

168
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,525
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

169
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,044
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

170
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,254
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

171
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

172
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,841
<i>and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.</i>

173
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,219
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

174
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,929
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

175
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,474
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,977
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,855
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,231
And I want to welcome you all

179
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,735
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,536
<i>Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,</i>

181
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,790
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

182
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,083
<i>so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.</i>

183
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,004
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

184
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,174
<i>All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,761
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.</i>

186
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,137
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

187
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,640
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

188
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,434
<i>Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.</i>

189
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,560
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

190
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,230
<i>and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

191
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,565
<i>And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

192
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,235
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.</i>

193
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,778
<i>This may be difficult. I'll come back later.</i>

194
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,655
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

195
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,408
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,159
<i>Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,</i>

197
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,371
<i>but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.</i>

198
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,124
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

199
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,085
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

200
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,547
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

201
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,684
Here you go.

202
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,982
<i>Done.</i>

203
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,151
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,904
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

205
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,614
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,700
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,868
How did you know that?

208
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,494
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,122
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,541
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,668
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,004
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,383
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,177
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,762
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,680
I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,350
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,897
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,733
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,942
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,529
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,031
Let's write it.

223
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,631
One on the left.

224
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,424
The right.

225
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,926
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,844
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,970
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,140
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,391
The question is,

230
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,061
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,466
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,637
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,265
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,600
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,395
Right or left?

236
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,272
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,274
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,360
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,486
Right.

240
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,779
Left.

241
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,447
- Left.
- Left?

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,867
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,035
Albright.

244
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,496
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,874
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,004
Left.

247
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,589
Latina.

248
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,882
Erica.

249
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,217
Is this yours?

250
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,760
I stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,888
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,557
- Left.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,142
Left.

254
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,318
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,739
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,790
Hello?

257
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,880
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,091
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,636
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,805
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,849
All right.

263
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,145
I gotta go in.

264
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,272
What's going on?

265
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,983
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,282
You don't think...

267
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,577
I do.

268
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,497
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,420
I can't connect.

270
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,382
The network's down.

271
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,134
Unless it's a coincidence,
I think this is us.

272
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,678
It's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,638
Holy shit.

274
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,477
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,229
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,939
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,776
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,486
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,238
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,990
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,741
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,370
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,871
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,707
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,460
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,379
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,089
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,257
She was under oath.

289
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,718
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,523
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,983
Thousand.

292
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,234
What?

293
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,195
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,885
These guys are just freakin' fast.

295
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,018
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

296
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,853
Jump out and swim.

297
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,481
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

298
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,609
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

299
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,945
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

300
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,113
Just row the damn boat.

301
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,956
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

302
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,668
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

303
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,253
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

304
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,838
How?

305
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,966
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

306
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,885
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

307
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,011
I don't know.

308
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,639
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

309
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,182
Full course load. Studying.

310
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,559
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

311
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,852
I'm not sure how we missed it.

312
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,562
How much activity was there on this thing?

313
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,439
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

314
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,358
Twenty-two thousand?

315
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,902
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

316
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,655
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

317
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,906
Twenty-two thousand?

318
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,409
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

319
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,163
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

320
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,915
This is our guy.

321
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,917
Cameron Winklevoss.

322
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,212
W-l-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

323
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,588
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

324
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,257
Tyler Winklevoss.

325
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,677
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

326
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,472
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

327
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,767
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

328
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,269
violating copyrights,

329
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:11,649
violating individual privacy by creating
the website www.facemash.com.

330
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,527
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

331
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,821
on distribution of digitized images.

332
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,949
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

333
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,242
Would you like to do so?

334
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,286
I...

335
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:29,000
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

336
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,668
to Fuerza Latina,

337
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,087
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

338
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,423
as I take it that they were.

339
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,384
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

340
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,345
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

341
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,474
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

342
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,560
I don't understand.

343
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,686
Which part?

344
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,855
You deserve recognition?

345
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,066
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

346
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,152
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

347
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,654
Mr. Zuckerberg,

348
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,949
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

349
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,452
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

350
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,122
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

351
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,832
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

352
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,958
That would be impressive,

353
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,376
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

354
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,253
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

355
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,010
So?

356
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,429
Six months academic probation.

357
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:25,765
Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

358
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,433
They had my blog.

359
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,686
I shouldn't have written that thing
about the farm animals. That was stupid.

360
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,856
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humour?

361
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,359
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

362
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,987
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

363
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,989
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

364
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,575
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

365
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,744
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

366
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,206
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

367
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,583
and a page size of 256 bytes.

368
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,880
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

369
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,592
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

370
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,346
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

371
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,307
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

372
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,227
The eight status bits would then be...

373
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,603
Anybody?

374
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,315
And I see we have our first surrender.

375
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,692
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

376
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,986
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

377
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,865
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

378
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,202
That is correct.

379
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,163
Does everybody see how he got there?

380
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,004
Mark?

381
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,048
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,342
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

383
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,468
Tyler Winklevoss.

384
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,928
Are you guys related?

385
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,513
- That's good.
- Funny.

386
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,056
We never heard that before.

387
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,434
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

388
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,602
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

389
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,396
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

390
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,522
No.

391
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,566
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

392
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,943
You got a minute?

393
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,071
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

394
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,698
- We have to.
- Why?

395
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,199
We row crew.

396
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,119
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

397
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,126
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

398
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,836
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

399
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,004
because you're not a member.

400
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,505
I've heard.

401
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,261
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

402
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,013
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,098
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

404
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,017
We were really impressed with Facemash.

405
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,686
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

406
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,812
I don't know CourseMatch.

407
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,315
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

408
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,025
It's really smart, man.

409
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,278
- Mark.
- Yeah.

410
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,155
We were talking about CourseMatch.

411
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,200
It was kind of a no-brainer.

412
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,243
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

413
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,747
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

414
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,791
Anybody try to buy it?

415
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,459
Microsoft.

416
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,797
- How much?
- Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

417
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,548
- For free?
- Yeah.

418
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,841
Why?

419
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,262
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

420
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,430
and we think it's great.

421
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,765
It's called the Harvard Connection.

422
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:16,268
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

423
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,646
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

424
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,148
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

425
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,153
Harvard.edu.

426
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,656
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

427
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,075
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

428
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,077
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

429
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,912
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

430
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,289
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

431
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,876
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

432
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,378
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

433
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,214
Is exclusivity. Right?

434
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,091
- Right.
- Yeah.

435
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,634
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

436
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,428
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

437
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,138
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

438
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,141
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

439
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,685
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

440
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:00,688
You would do that for me?

441
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,358
We'd like to work with you.

442
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,528
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

443
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,197
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

444
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,492
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

445
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,869
I'm in.

446
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,538
What?

447
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
I'm in.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,958
Awesome.

449
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,710
That's what you said?

450
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,088
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

451
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,506
When did you come to Eduardo?

452
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,592
I don't understand that question.

453
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,343
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

454
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,179
The affirmative?

455
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,222
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

456
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,932
It was called The Facebook then.

457
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,560
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

458
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,146
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

459
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,606
Did you answer affirmatively

460
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,150
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

461
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,818
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

462
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,570
Did you say yes?

463
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,448
I said I'd help.

464
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,534
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

465
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,119
I wouldn't say I approached him.

466
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,371
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

467
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,874
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

468
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,334
What's that?

469
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,377
The Jewish fraternity.

470
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,214
It was Caribbean Night.

471
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,150
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

472
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,153
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

473
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,280
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

474
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,282
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

475
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,369
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

476
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,413
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

477
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,957
Hey, Mark's here.

478
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,250
Mark!

479
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,963
Be right back.

480
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,555
I think I've come up with something.

481
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,848
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

482
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,975
What?

483
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,352
I got punched by the Phoenix.

484
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,646
- Are you kidding?
- No.

485
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,065
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

486
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,943
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

487
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,903
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

488
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,154
So...

489
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,657
You got punched by the Phoenix.

490
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,451
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

491
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,037
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

492
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,831
What did you wanna talk to me about?

493
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,374
- Mark?
- Yeah.

494
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
You said you'd come up with something.

495
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,211
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

496
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,588
It's 20 degrees outside.

497
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,840
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

498
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,009
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

499
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,147
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

500
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,315
Yeah.

501
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,983
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

502
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,277
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

503
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,403
Yeah.

504
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,156
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

505
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,575
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

506
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,118
so why not build a website that offers that?

507
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,330
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

508
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,206
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

509
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,417
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

510
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:13,922
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

511
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,592
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

512
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,218
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

513
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,386
Yeah?

514
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,555
"It would be exclusive."

515
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,642
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

516
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,602
Like getting punched.

517
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,604
Now, that's good.

518
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,856
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

519
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,109
I told him I thought it sounded great.

520
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,236
It was a great idea.

521
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,363
There was nothing to hack.

522
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,491
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

523
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:45,371
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

524
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,500
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

525
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,418
that was the thing.

526
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,295
It was a big project,

527
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,548
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

528
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,259
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

529
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,012
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

530
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,474
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

531
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,685
So that was why.

532
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,395
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

533
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,438
We'll split it, 70/30.

534
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,066
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

535
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,402
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

536
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,528
<i>And you said?</i>

537
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,238
I said, "Let's do it."

538
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,198
Okay. Did he add anything else?

539
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,658
Yes.

540
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,956
It probably was a diversity thing.

541
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,333
But so what?

542
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,793
Why do you think he said that?

543
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,087
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

544
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,922
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

545
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,090
What are you suggesting?

546
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,342
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

547
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,010
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

548
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,804
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

549
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,139
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

550
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,473
Stop typing. We're off the record.

551
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,599
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

552
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,268
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

553
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,353
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

554
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,648
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

555
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,863
I'll let you know how the party is.

556
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,997
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

557
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,498
and a witness in another.

558
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,666
Yes, sir.

559
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,753
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

560
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,338
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

561
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,716
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

562
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,469
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

563
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,473
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

564
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,141
He said even his most pathetic friends

565
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:33,103
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

566
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,105
"These guys," meaning my clients.

567
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,151
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

568
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,653
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

569
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,822
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

570
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,700
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

571
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,411
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

572
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,122
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

573
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,666
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

574
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,543
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

575
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,796
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

576
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,509
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

577
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,635
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

578
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,803
Ty.

579
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,223
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

580
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,768
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

581
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,311
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

582
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,064
We are about to find it in evidence.

583
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,983
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.</i>

584

the basic functionality up tomorrow night."</i>

I just got about three of your missed calls.</i>

590
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,298

<i>"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,</i>

594
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,393
<i>"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

595
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,603
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

596
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,065
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

597
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,191
Tell him okay,

598
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,027
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

599
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,364
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

600
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,521
Hey, Mark.

601
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,524
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

602
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,109
It's gonna cost a little more money.

603
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,570
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

604
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,156
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

605
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,369
- Do it.
- I already did.

606
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,833
Hey, guess what?

607
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,170
I made the second cut.

608
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,922
That's good.

609
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,675
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

610
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,973
I'll get out of here.

611
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,392
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

612
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,518
and Divya Narendra.

613
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,771
December 15th, 2003.

614
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,231
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

615
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,985
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

616
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,405
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

617
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,616
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

618
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,869
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

619
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:40,582
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

620
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:49,132
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

621
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,551
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

622
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,471
What are the three lies?

623
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,431
Mr. Dowd.

624
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,642
The three lies. First...

625
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,851
Shit!

626
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,770
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

627
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,189
Mr. Saverin.

628
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,818
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

629
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,237
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

630
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,863
And three, that is not John Harvard.

631
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,281
Who is it?

632
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,494
It's a friend of the sculptor,
Daniel Chester.

633
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,538
Keep your jacket on.

634
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,962
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

635
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,424
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

636
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,301
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

637
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,264
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

638
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,142
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

639
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,272
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

640
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,483
Not to my knowledge. No.

641
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,906
What in the world is this?

642
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:00,120
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little sceptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

643
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,789
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

644
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,500
"to get a site like this to run"?

645
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,419
"We'll speak soon"?

646
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,340
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

647
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,508
Yes, it was.

648
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:18,096
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

649
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,766
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

650
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,892
That's correct.

651
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,644
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

652
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,813
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

653
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,440
Did I use any of your code?

654
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,358
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

655
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,652
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

656
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,862
Can I continue with my deposition?

657
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,074
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

658
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,784
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

659
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,162
you'd have invented Facebook.

660
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,540
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

661
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,917
No shit.

662
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,003
Let's continue.

663
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,132
February 4, 2004.

664
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,806
Mark.

665
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,768
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

666
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,728
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

667
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,398
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

668
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,695
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

669
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,072
Dustin.

670
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,285
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

671
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,582
Mark?

672
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,444
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

673
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,281
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

674
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,532
What?

675
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,670
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

676
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,213
It's clean and simple.

677
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,008
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

678
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,136
What'd you write?

679
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,181
"Relationship Status."
"Interested In."

680
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,184
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

681
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,562
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

682
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:34,524
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

683
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,818
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

684
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,944
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

685
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,238
- Gonna get laid.
...meet a girl. Yes.

686
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,865
That is really good.

687
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,991
And that was it.

688
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,743
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

689
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,953
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

690
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,039
And here's the masthead.

691
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,582
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

692
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:54,044
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

693
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,171
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

694
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,589
Sure I do.

695
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,135
So when's it going live?

696
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,138
Right now. Get your laptop out.

697
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,891
What? Why do we need my laptop?

698
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,478
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

699
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,069
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

700
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,863
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

701
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,282
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

702
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,700
I haven't gotten in yet.

703
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,828
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

704
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,873
- Sure.
- Good.

705
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,167
Give me the mailing list.

706
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,586
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

707
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,837
These guys.

708
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,964
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

709
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,174
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

710
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,801
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

711
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,678
Yeah, you're right.

712
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,103
The site's live.

713
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,231
You know,
let's go get a drink and celebrate.

714
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,150
I'm buying.

715
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,736
Mark.

716
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,907
Mark, are you praying?

717
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,881
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

718
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,050
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

719
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,176
Good point.

720
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,179
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

721
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,352
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

722
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,396
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

723
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,064
- KC.
- What is it?

724
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,190
I don't know.

725
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,026
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

726
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,819
'cause I can never get enough of that.

727
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,489
No, it's not.

728
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,202
Div!

729
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,955
What?

730
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,712
This isn't mine.

731
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,547
Okay, what is wrong?

732
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,969
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

733
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,653
Hey!

734
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,905
Not now!

735
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,073
We need 20 minutes!

736
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,532
Okay.

737
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,870
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

738
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,123
Mark Zuckerberg?

739
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,417
He stole our website.

740
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,878
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

741
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,594
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

742
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,222
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

743
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,348
"Welcome to The Facebook.

744
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,350
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

745
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,893
"through different social networks.

746
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,146
"You must have a harvard.edu address
to register."

747
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,690
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

748
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,109
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

749
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,235
I can read it to you.

750
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,530
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

751
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,656
"He" meaning Mark.

752
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,699
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

753
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,909
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

754
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,537
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week."'

755
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,830
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

756
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,998
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

757
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,167
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

758
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,004
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com.

759
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,675
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

760
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,011
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

761
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,349
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

762
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,936
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

763
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,521
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

764
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,523
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

765
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,358
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

766
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,528
Because you don't have a Harvard...

767
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,947
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

768
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,031
I'm sure you're right.

769
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,034
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

770
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,704
...what he did.

771
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,039
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

772
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,708
All right, love you, too.

773
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,544
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

774
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,628
We know he stole our idea.

775
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,130
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

776
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,382
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

777
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,886
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

778
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,971
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

779
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,806
which is that getting there first
is everything.

780
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,891
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

781
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,394
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

782
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,813
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

783
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,815
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

784
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

785
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,067
What's that gonna do?

786
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,486
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

787
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,739
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

788
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,907
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

789
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,327
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

790
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,411
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

791
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,914
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

792
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,082
How much more information
are you waiting for?

793
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,002
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

794
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,670
we can prove that he looked at the code.

795
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,840
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

796
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,176
- On the home page?
- On every page.

797
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,929
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

798
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,096
Okay, look, we don't know...

799
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,098
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

800
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,100
"would help restore his reputation

801
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,187
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."

802
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,607
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

803
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,360
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

804
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,862
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

805
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,447
- What?
...that this is in dispute.

806
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,616
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

807
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,117
And we're not suing anybody.

808
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,536
Why not?

809
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,456
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

810
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,459
He's gonna say it's stupid.

811
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,544
What, who, me?

812
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,128
Say it. Why not?

813
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,715
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

814
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,136
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

815
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,723
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

816
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,476
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

817
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,647
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

818
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,816
"A family of means"?

819
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,442
Did you know their father was wealthy?

820
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,987
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

821
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,322
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

822
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,408
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

823
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,327
Did you know that they came from money?

824
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,329
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

825
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,415
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

826
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,835
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

827
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,169
If you say so.

828
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,007
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

829
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,342
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

830
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,761
of a Harvard final club
called the Porcellian.

831
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,096
They pointed that out.

832
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,181
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

833
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,269
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

834
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:28,938
Yes.

835
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,440
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

836
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,943
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

837
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,612
you didn't ask my clients for it.

838
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,197
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

839
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,367
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

840
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,953
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

841
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,997
and he was also my best friend.

842
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,460
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

843
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,379
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

844
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,715
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

845
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,051
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

846
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,802
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

847
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,888
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

848
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,641
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

849
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,142
It exploded.

850
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,061
Everybody on campus was using it.

851
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,731
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

852
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,232
And Mark?

853
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,153
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

854
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:21,741
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

855
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,493
Who was the movie star?

856
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,161
Does it matter?

857
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,579
No.

858
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:32,627
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine

859
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,921
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

860
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,548
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

861
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,676
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

862
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,638
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

863
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,891
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

864
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,353
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

865
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,730
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

866
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:57,068
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

867
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,280
Unless you paid extra for
a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

868
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,785
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

869
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,790
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

870
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,960
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

871
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,336
Yeah.

872
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,630
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

873
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,299
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

874
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,260
Yeah, we... Yes.

875
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,511
Cool.

876
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,263
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

877
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,389
Hi.

878
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,683
Well, very nice to meet you.

879
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,518
Facebook me when you get home.

880
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,145
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

881
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
Certainly.

882
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,982
Absolutely do that.

883
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,950
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

884
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,577
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

885
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,371
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

886
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,497
They wanna have drinks later.

887
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,207
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

888
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,834
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

889
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,627
Excuse me, Mark?

890
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,254
Yeah?

891
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,173
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

892
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,883
Sure.

893
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,218
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

894
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,344
Thanks.

895
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,263
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

896
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,765
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

897
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,059
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

898
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,644
I doubt it.

899
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,272
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

900
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,192
It was Bill Gates.

901
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,445
Shit, that makes sense.

902
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,364
All right. Thanks, guys.

903
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,577
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

904
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,370
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

905
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,289
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

906
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,750
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

907
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,961
It's time to monetize the thing.

908
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,338
What were their names?

909
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,215
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

910
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,383
I said it's time to monetize the site.

911
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,385
What does that mean?

912
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,305
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

913
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,724
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

914
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,727
- Advertising.
- No.

915
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,271
Well, we got 4,000 members.

916
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,523
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

917
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,818
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

918
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,528
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

919
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,072
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

920
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,367
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

921
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,911
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

922
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,329
We know that it is cool.

923
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,623
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

924
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,917
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

925
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,710
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

926
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,088
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

927
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,631
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

928
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,300
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

929
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,762
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

930
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,515
Mark, what is this?

931
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,058
- What?
- This.

932
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,435
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

933
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,562
- Who?
- The girls.

934
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,813
When did you get this?

935
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,023
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

936
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,942
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

937
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,153
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

938
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,614
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

939
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,951
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

940
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,244
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

941
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,829
It was addressed to me.

942
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,040
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

943
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,167
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

944
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,294
Did we what?

945
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,962
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

946
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,298
The letter says we could face legal action.

947
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,049
No, it says I could face legal action.

948
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,385
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

949
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,597
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

950
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,098
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

951
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,600
and Harvard Connection is lame.

952
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,935
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

953
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,061
I didn't use anything.

954
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,980
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

955
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,690
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

956
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,609
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

957
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,403
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

958
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,907
Okay.

959
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,830
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

960
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,541
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

961
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,086
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

962
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,630
No.

963
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,468
What are we doing about this?

964
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,971
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

965
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,222
And what did you say?

966
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,434
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

967
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,895
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

968
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,396
"that I had not anticipated."

969
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,732
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

970
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:08,069
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

971
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,739
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

972
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,449
I'd raised concerns before.

973
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,784
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

974
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,913
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

975
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,039
Yeah.

976
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,999
Let me rephrase this.

977
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,754
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

978
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:27,922
Is that a question?

979
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,550
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

980
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,387
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

981
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,556
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

982
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,517
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

983
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,851
It just started raining.

984
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,021
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

985
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,940
No.

986
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,401
Do you think I deserve it?

987
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,735
What?

988
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,780
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

989
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,366
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

990
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,577
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

991
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,456
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

992
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,584
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

993
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,794
they have a right to give it a try,

994
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,214
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

995
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,718
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

996
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,013
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

997
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,390
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

998
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,058
including and especially your clients,

999
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,478
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1000
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,274
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1001
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,951
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1002
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,246
Back at 2:30.

1003
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,207
So what were their names?

1004
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,003
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1005
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,091
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1006
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,597
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1007
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,242
Oh, my God.

1008
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,661
I don't care.

1009
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,851
Hey, man, sorry.

1010
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,854
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1011
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,273
Sweet.

1012
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,404
We have groupies.

1013
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,206
I'll be right back.

1014
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,083
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1015
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,381
Erica?

1016
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,342
Hi.

1017
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,053
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1018
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,847
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1019
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,807
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1020
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,268
I think I'm good right here.

1021
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:31,397
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1022
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,731
Right here is fine.

1023
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,526
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1024
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,694
No.

1025
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,281
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1026
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,199
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1027
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,285
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1028
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,995
Comparing women to farm animals.

1029
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,955
I didn't end up doing that.

1030
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,707
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1031
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,376
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1032
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,753
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1033
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,883
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1034
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,886
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1035
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,348
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1036
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,267
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1037
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,478
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1038
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,690
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1039
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,568
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1040
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,613
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1041
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,656
If we could just go somewhere
for a minute...

1042
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,950
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1043
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,453
Okay.

1044
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,624
Good luck with your video game.

1045
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,626
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1046
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,628
You apologized, right?

1047
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,632
We have to expand.

1048
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,133
Sure. Mark?

1049
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,054
Is he mad about something?

1050
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,307
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1051
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,100
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1052
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,977
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1053
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,271
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1054
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,397
It's The Bridge.

1055
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,732
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1056
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,734
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1057
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,237
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programming.

1058
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,030
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1059
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,323
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1060
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,408
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1061
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,035
Dustin is vice president
and head of programming,

1062
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,704
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1063
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,081
Chris is director of publicity,

1064
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,541
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1065
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,668
Any questions?

1066
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,338
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1067
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,714
- Hi.
- Hi.

1068
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,216
- Hello.
- Hi.

1069
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,134
Is there anything we can do?

1070
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,302
No, that's it.

1071
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,721
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1072
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,432
- What?
- Stanford.

1073
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,726
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1074
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,942
You don't want any lunch?

1075
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,110
No.

1076
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,195
You're welcome to some salad.

1077
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,822
No, thank you.

1078
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,162
This must be hard.

1079
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,748
Who are you?

1080
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,835
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1081
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,295
I mean, what do you do?

1082
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,505
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1083
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,174
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1084
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,969
What are you doing?

1085
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:10,055
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1086
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,390
Bosnia.

1087
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,685
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1088
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,359
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1089
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,445
I don't hate anybody.

1090
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,949
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1091
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,577
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1092
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,079
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1093
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,213
He's expanding.

1094
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,465
What?

1095
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,966
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1096
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,217
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.

1097
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,344
- Really?
- Yep.

1098
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,680
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1099
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,059
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1100
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,103
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1101
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,981
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1102
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,107
And I want him dead.

1103
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,275
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1104
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,651
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1105
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,028
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1106
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,821
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1107
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,947
How's it gonna look?

1108
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,240
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1109
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,576
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1110
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,288
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1111
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,207
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1112
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,625
he'll have violated federal law.

1113
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,502
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1114
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,504
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1115
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,090
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1116
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,513
Harvard Student Handbook.

1117
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,391
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1118
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,892
You can't steal from another student.

1119
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,604
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1120
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,564
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1121
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,483
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1122
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,778
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1123
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,322
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1124
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,867
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1125
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,452
Why Stanford?

1126
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,329
Why do you think?

1127
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,960
I'm sorry.

1128
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,628
I'm late for biochem.

1129
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,339
Okay.

1130
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,427
You don't know my name, do you?

1131
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,262
Is it Stanford?

1132
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,931
I should just kick your ass.

1133
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,183
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1134
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,520
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1135
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,773
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1136
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,442
What's my major?

1137
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,527
- Trombone.
- Really?

1138
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,029
I remember something about a trombone.

1139
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,118
French.

1140
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,286
Your major's French.

1141
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,037
- And yours?
- Mine?

1142
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,331
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1143
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,792
I don't go to school.

1144
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,711
- You're kidding.
- No.

1145
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,046
Well, where did you go to school?

1146
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,466
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1147
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,633
Seriously?

1148
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,636
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1149
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,388
No.

1150
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,140
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1151
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,349
No.

1152
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,561
So, what do you do?

1153
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,314
I'm an entrepreneur.

1154
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,900
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1155
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,067
What would you say?

1156
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,319
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1157
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,070
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1158
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:16,825
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1159
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,243
Kind of like Napster?

1160
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,745
Exactly like Napster.

1161
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,497
What do you mean?

1162
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,915
I founded Napster.

1163
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,000
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1164
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,418
Nice to meet you.

1165
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,337
You're Sean Parker?

1166
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,255
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1167
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,424
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1168
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,260
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1169
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,054
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1170
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,681
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1171
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,266
What are you?

1172
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,602
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1173
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,022
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1174
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,607
This is blowing my mind.

1175
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,691
I appreciate that.

1176
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,610
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1177
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:55,113
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1178
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,865
You passed.

1179
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,283
I'm a hard worker.

1180
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,622
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1181
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,790
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1182
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,959
Yeah, go ahead.

1183
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,136
Amy!

1184
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,473
Jesus.

1185
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,892
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1186
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,270
Just a second.

1187
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,732
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1188
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,900
What?

1189
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,404
Where?

1190
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,905
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1191
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,991
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1192
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,242
How?

1193
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:44,079
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1194
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,831
What do you need to ask me?

1195
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,750
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1196
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:53,088
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1197
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,340
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1198
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,427
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1199
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,763
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1200
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,182
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1201
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,767
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1202
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,352
Yeah, is everything okay?

1203
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,271
Everything's great.

1204
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:14,276
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1205
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,781
I've never been in this building before.

1206
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:24,202
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1207
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,205
We're sitting in chairs.

1208
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,166
Yes.

1209
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,377
Very good. You can go in now.

1210
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,635
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1211
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,303
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1212
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,222
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1213
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,224
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1214
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,226
Students. Undergrads.

1215
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,811
I don't know.

1216
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,648
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1217
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,982
All right, bye-bye.

1218
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,901
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1219
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,903
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1220
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,072
And you're here because...

1221
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,574
Either of you can answer.

1222
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,159
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1223
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,327
I've read the letter.

1224
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,664
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1225
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,917
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1226
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,418
I understand.

1227
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,004
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1228
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:20,008
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1229
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,427
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1230
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:26,181
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1231
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,684
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1232
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,269
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1233
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,772
and instances of theft,
misappropriation or...

1234
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,357
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1235
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,275
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1236
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:44,199
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1237
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,284
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1238
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,453
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1239
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,957
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1240
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,210
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1241
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,545
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1242
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,964
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1243
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,632
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1244
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,551
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1245
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,470
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1246
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,638
for the last two weeks.

1247
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,557
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1248
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,475
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1249
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,894
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1250
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,062
You chased him?

1251
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,732
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1252
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:20,902
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1253
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,405
There's a code of ethics and an honour code
and he violated them both.

1254
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,950
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1255
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,996
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1256
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,247
I'm devastated by that.

1257
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,000
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1258
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,252
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1259
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,671
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1260
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,089
This isn't petty larceny.

1261
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,341
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1262
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,593
- Millions?
- Yes.

1263
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,262
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1264
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,182
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1265
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:54,519
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1266
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,937
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1267
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,939
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1268
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,026
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1269
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,444
run away with you on a new project.

1270
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,695
You would?

1271
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,197
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1272
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:09,951
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1273
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,789
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new, new project.

1274
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,958
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1275
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,794
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1276
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,378
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1277
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,297
And you're saying that I don't?

1278
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,382
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1279
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,176
- Really?
- Sir.

1280
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,303
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1281
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,305
Colleagues of their father.

1282
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,142
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1283
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,645
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1284
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,982
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1285
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,569
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1286
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,072
You don't get special treatment.

1287
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,658
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1288
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,576
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1289
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,161
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1290
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,329
We never asked for special treatment.

1291
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:58,083
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1292
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,835
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1293
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,002
Ty.

1294
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,880
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1295
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,387
Whoops.

1296
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,098
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1297
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,853
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1298
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,522
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1299
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:24,276
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1300
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,111
Who paid for the trip?

1301
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,281
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1302
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:33,201
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1303
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,287
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1304
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,874
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1305
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,208
Mark was asleep.

1306
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,710
I was not asleep.

1307
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,128
Can I rephrase my answer?

1308
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,297
I wish he'd been asleep.

1309
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:51,595
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1310
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,555
People who go on The Facebook

1311
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,057
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1312
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,893
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1313
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,979
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1314
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,939
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1315
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,400
What sound is he making?
Is that like a tsk?

1316
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,071
It wasn't a tsk.

1317
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,573
It was...

1318
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,326
Like a glottal stop.

1319
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,661
Almost a gag reflex.

1320
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,998
Guys, what is this?

1321
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,751
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1322
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,169
Yes, it was a dinner.

1323
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,670
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1324
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,840
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1325
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,176
Yes. Very.

1326
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,261
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1327
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,180
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1328
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,099
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1329
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,101
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1330
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,937
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1331
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,022
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1332
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,273
It isn't a business yet.

1333
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,152
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1334
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,531
He's 25 minutes late.

1335
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,368
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1336
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,119
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1337
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,704
He's 25 minutes late.

1338
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,039
I think Wardo's jealous.

1339
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,334
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1340
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,543
Why?

1341
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,130
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1342
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,509
And he struck me as kind of a...

1343
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,845
A wild card.

1344
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,055
Why?

1345
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:20,475
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1346
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,977
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1347
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,311
He also founded the companies.

1348
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,729
We don't need him.

1349
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,398
He's here.

1350
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,152
No, no, take your time.

1351
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,989
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1352
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,075
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1353
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,078
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1354
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,163
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1355
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,748
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1356
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:44,916
- No.
- Tori.

1357
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,001
We were waiting.

1358
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,253
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1359
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,172
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1360
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,091
And the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.

1361
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,093
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1362
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,929
An appletini.

1363
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,056
Great. Four of those.

1364
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,435
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1365
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,946
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1366
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,710
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1367
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,796
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1368
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,966
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humour.

1369
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,303
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1370
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:42,891
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1371
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,061
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1372
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,813
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1373
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,648
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1374
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,942
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1375
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,654
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1376
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,740
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1377
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,744
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1378
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,747
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1379
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,000
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1380
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,336
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1381
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,297
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1382
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,925
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1383
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,094
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1384
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,513
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1385
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,182
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1386
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,851
Private behaviour is a relic
of a time gone by.

1387
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,771
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1388
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,022
they'll make shit up.

1389
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,691
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1390
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,527
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1391
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,028
Excuse me.

1392
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,530
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1393
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,697
That's what happened to you?

1394
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,366
And delusional.

1395
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,120
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1396
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,788
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1397
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,206
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1398
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,792
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1399
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,210
They won.

1400
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,045
- In court.
- Yeah.

1401
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,965
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1402
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,804
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1403
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,891
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1404
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:11,896
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1405
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,150
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1406
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,735
So, tell me about your progress.

1407
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,406
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1408
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,241
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1409
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,326
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1410
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,245
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1411
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,913
So instead of going right after them,

1412
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,082
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1413
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,250
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1414
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,170
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1415
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,588
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1416
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,089
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1417
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,924
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1418
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,926
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1419
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,928
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1420
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,263
Well...

1421
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,182
Neither of you yet.

1422
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,601
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1423
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:50,768
Yeah.

1424
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,520
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1425
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,688
Exactly.

1426
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,273
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1427
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,608
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1428
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,775
That's exactly right.

1429
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,028
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1430
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:03,823
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1431
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,825
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1432
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,951
You?

1433
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,080
"A billion dollars."

1434
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,294
And that shut everybody up.

1435
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,464
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1436
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,884
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1437
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,802
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1438
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:29,015
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1439
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,393
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1440
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,312
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1441
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,480
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1442
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,941
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1443
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,067
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1444
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:42,111
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1445
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,822
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1446
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,449
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1447
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:50,828
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1448
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,747
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1449
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,042
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1450
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,210
and he was gone.

1451
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:01,172
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1452
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,010
Drop the "The."
Just "Facebook."

1453
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,137
It's cleaner.

1454
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,100
Shit.

1455
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,853
Goodbye, sweetie.

1456
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:18,106
Yeah.

1457
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,904
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1458
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,156
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1459
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,369
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1460
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:33,663
So, what do you think?

1461
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,707
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1462
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,918
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1463
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,295
Doesn't that sound good?

1464
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,088
If you're a trout.

1465
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,715
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1466
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,719
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1467
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,887
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1468
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,557
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1469
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,394
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1470
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,605
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1471
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,773
Yeah, we stipulate.

1472
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,735
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1473
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,445
You have anything here?

1474
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,821
Yes. Thank you.

1475
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,615
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1476
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,285
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1477
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,163
No.

1478
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:19,792
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1479
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,794
- No.
- No?

1480
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,424
No.

1481
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,676
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1482
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,722
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1483
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,058
This is not happening.

1484
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,477
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1485
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,644
Jesus Christ.

1486
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:39,771
I can't have this, Wardo.

1487
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,316
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1488
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,111
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1489
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,822
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1490
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:53,910
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1491
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:56,621
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1492
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,081
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1493
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,124
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1494
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,542
is probably bad for business.

1495
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:06,464
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1496
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,385
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1497
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,261
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1498
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:15,181
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1499
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:16,974
and I had the chicken with me,

1500
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,060
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1501
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,228
This was college.

1502
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,397
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1503
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,024
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1504
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,527
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1505
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,822
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1506
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,074
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1507
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,867
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1508
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,329
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1509
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,748
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1510
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,042
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1511
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,002
This was all resolved.

1512
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,129
988.

1513
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,256
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1514
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,174
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1515
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,968
All right, let's just forget about it.

1516
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:55,012
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1517
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,556
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1518
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,266
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1519
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,727
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1520
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,229
What is happening on that?

1521
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,398
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1522
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,732
and I haven't been to class.

1523
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,067
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1524
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,777
That's a Facebook page?

1525
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,903
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1526
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,405
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1527
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,491
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1528
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,994
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1529
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,872
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1530
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,708
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1531
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,961
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1532
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,217
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1533
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,927
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1534
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,763
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

1535
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,558
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1536
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,522
993. We are so close.

1537
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,318
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1538
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,445
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1539
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,280
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1540
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:55,448
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1541
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,492
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1542
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,327
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1543
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,745
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1544
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,830
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1545
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,165
You mean when did I actually decide?

1546
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,418
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1547
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,046
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1548
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,547
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1549
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,674
I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.

1550
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,426
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1551
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,846
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1552
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,973
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1553
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:24,644
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1554
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,646
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1555
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,315
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1556
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,609
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1557
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,152
Hit "Refresh."

1558
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,989
150,004.

1559
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,450
150,000 members, Wardo.

1560
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,160
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1561
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,706
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1562
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,458
Who came up with nothing.

1563
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,502
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1564
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,712
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1565
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,339
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1566
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:57,093
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1567
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,638
What's he talking about?

1568
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,391
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1569
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,642
Get on board with this, man.

1570
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:07,270
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1571
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,004
You can do one more! One more!

1572
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:38,759
Wardo!

1573
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,136
Yo! Mark!

1574
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:43,097
What's going on?

1575
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,558
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1576
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:46,934
expose its SSL encryption,

1577
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,644
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1578
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,812
They're hacking.

1579
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,939
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1580
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,858
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1581
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,067
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1582
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,069
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1583
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,156
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1584
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,074
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1585
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,868
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1586
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,786
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1587
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,872
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1588
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,082
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1589
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,627
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1590
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,339
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1591
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,465
You're right.

1592
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,843
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1593
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,555
- That was mean.
- Here.

1594
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:25,765
What is this?

1595
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:28,934
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1596
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,271
Will that get you through the summer?

1597
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,397
- Here!
- Mark?

1598
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,899
Right here!

1599
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,906
Welcome to Facebook.

1600
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,000
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1601
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,419
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1602
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,089
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1603
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,423
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1604
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,052
I'm just checking your math on that.

1605
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,471
Yes, I got the same thing.

1606
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,139
May I continue?

1607
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:10,643
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1608
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:12,770
and moving it to California for the summer,

1609
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,856
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1610
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:19,694
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1611
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,863
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1612
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,408
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1613
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:30,037
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1614
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,624
Go, go, go, go, go.

1615
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,839
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1616
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,757
- I made it.
- You did.

1617
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,510
Okay, ready?

1618
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,846
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1619
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,306
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1620
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,024
I'm okay.

1621
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,359
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1622
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,069
Yikes.

1623
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,822
That's the doorbell.

1624
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,115
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1625
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,909
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1626
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,995
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1627
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,165
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1628
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,583
Good boy.

1629
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,046
- Sean?
- Mark?

1630
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,090
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1631
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:24,425
Do you?

1632
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,051
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1633
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,721
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1634
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,307
I'm Sharon.

1635
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,726
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1636
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,144
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1637
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,188
We had a zip line to the pool.

1638
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:40,524
You came to California.

1639
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,026
Yeah.

1640
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,236
You made the right choice.

1641
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,202
Here you go.

1642
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:56,916
Sharon?

1643
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,377
I'm so sorry.

1644
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,504
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1645
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,631
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1646
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:09,094
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1647
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,222
I'm Sean Parker.

1648
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,431
Oh, he's wired in.

1649
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,642
That's what I'm talking about.

1650
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,353
Where's Eduardo?

1651
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,939
He got an internship in New York.

1652
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,982
Eduardo didn't come out?

1653
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:45,297
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1654
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:48,843
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1655
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,388
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1656
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:54,932
What's your plan for the summer?

1657
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,309
Mark?

1658
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,104
I'm sorry.
I was looking at the architecture.

1659
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,773
I asked what your plan for the...

1660
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,358
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1661
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,193
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1662
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,320
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1663
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,450
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1664
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,119
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1665
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,453
What do you mean?

1666
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,834
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1667
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,753
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1668
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,672
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1669
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,091
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1670
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:33,178
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1671
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,265
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1672
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:39,059
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1673
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,980
Starts a catalogue, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1674
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,317
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1675
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:47,651
Happy ending, right?

1676
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:52,448
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1677
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:55,826
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1678
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:01,832
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1679
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,418
Was that a parable?

1680
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:09,423
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1681
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:10,966
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1682
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,301
I read your blog.

1683
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,428
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1684
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:16,180
You know why I started Napster?

1685
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:22,144
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1686
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:24,271
and I wanted to take her from him.

1687
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,273
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1688
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:29,234
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1689
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:32,780
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1690
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:37,117
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1691
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,662
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1692
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,414
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1693
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,291
What the VCs want is to say,

1694
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:47,211
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1695
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,922
But not this time. This is our time.

1696
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:53,842
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1697
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,636
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1698
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:58,722
That's what I want for you.

1699
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:01,058
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1700
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,687
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1701
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,730
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1702
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:11,402
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1703
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,363
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1704
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:15,572
I know you do.

1705
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,742
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1706
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,578
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1707
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,750
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1708
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,754
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1709
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:36,593
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1710
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:39,847
Do you ever think about that girl?

1711
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:40,973
What girl?

1712
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:44,435
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1713
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:46,770
No.

1714
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,399
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1715
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:51,984
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1716
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,110
Yeah.

1717
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,570
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1718
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:59,116
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1719
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,368
Two...

1720
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,291
If you don't have a place to crash,

1721
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,668
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1722
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,546
Let's line up some shots.

1723
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,757
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1724
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,968
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1725
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,970
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1726
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:39,156
Attention... Go!

1727
01:24:56,007 --> 01:25:00,511
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1728
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,522
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1729
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,733
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1730
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,206
Come on!

1731
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,204
Whatever.

1732
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:15,919
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1733
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,880
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1734
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:20,215
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1735
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,341
Sir?

1736
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,135
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1737
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,012
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1738
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:28,432
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1739
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:29,558
Yes, Your Highness.

1740
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:32,686
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1741
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:36,231
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1742
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,233
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1743
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,401
No, Your Highness.

1744
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:41,862
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1745
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:44,740
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

1746
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:45,991
May I introduce my teammates?

1747
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:48,035
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1748
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,786
On to the Dutch.

1749
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,666
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1750
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,919
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1751
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:59,630
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1752
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:03,258
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1753
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,010
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1754
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,136
Relax, it's fine.

1755
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:07,429
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1756
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:09,556
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1757
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,725
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1758
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:13,644
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1759
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,647
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1760
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,607
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1761
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,944
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1762
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,779
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1763
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:25,280
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1764
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,325
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1765
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,702
which they've just seen via their computers.

1766
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:34,665
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1767
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,168
I'm gonna find your mother.

1768
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:40,754
Have I said something wrong?

1769
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,714
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1770
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,132
No, no. Cambridge.

1771
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,969
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1772
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,136
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1773
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,305
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1774
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,473
That's where her friends are.

1775
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,558
That's awesome.

1776
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:57,521
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1777
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,233
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1778
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,863
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1779
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,323
Stop it.

1780
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,367
Stop it, Cam.

1781
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:12,244
Knock it off.

1782
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,372
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1783
01:28:15,498 --> 01:28:17,666
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1784
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,209
And they'll see us again.

1785
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:21,461
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1786
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,715
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1787
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,175
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1788
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,846
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1789
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,432
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1790
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:38,729
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1791
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:40,439
Come on.

1792
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,692
I need a real drink.

1793
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,575
Screw it.

1794
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,245
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1795
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,416
That's what I'm talking about!

1796
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,418
No, no, no, no, no.

1797
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,837
But check it out, I saw him today.

1798
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:06,340
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1799
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:07,507
Hang on.

1800
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,259
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1801
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,011
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1802
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:12,512
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1803
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,723
Like we know what that is.

1804
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:19,019
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1805
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:20,687
I know he did.

1806
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:26,068
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1807
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:27,569
Bong hit.

1808
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,780
Does anybody hear that banging?

1809
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:32,282
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1810
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,368
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1811
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:39,039
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1812
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,586
I'm gonna call you back.

1813
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:49,091
What's up?

1814
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,552
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1815
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,221
I've been calling his cell.

1816
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:58,809
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1817
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,149
What happened here?

1818
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:09,736
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1819
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:10,987
Wardo.

1820
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,072
Hey, man.

1821
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:14,157
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1822
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:17,160
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1823
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:18,787
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1824
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:20,580
We understand.

1825
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,084
How old are they, Sean?

1826
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,002
It's not polite to ask.

1827
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,254
Sean, how old are they?

1828
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:29,840
You think you know me, right?

1829
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,174
I've read enough.

1830
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,635
You know how much I've read about you?

1831
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,512
Nothing.

1832
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,101
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1833
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:44,104
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1834
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:47,524
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. In New York,
where I just came from.

1835
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:51,278
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1836
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,446
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1837
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,115
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1838
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,783
You know Peter Thiel?

1839
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,201
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1840
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,538
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1841
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,624
Why's he setting up meetings?

1842
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,792
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1843
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,962
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1844
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,715
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1845
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,050
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1846
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,052
and in between there was a long flight.

1847
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,888
I'm the business end of this company.

1848
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,057
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1849
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:24,060
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1850
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,481
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1851
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,232
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1852
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:32,527
You're just a small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1853
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:43,997
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1854
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:49,669
Bong hit.

1855
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:52,047
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1856
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,341
So how's it going?

1857
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,344
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1858
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,680
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1859
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,184
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1860
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:06,770
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1861
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:10,774
I do remember you saying that.

1862
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,734
So how is Christy?

1863
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,778
Christy's crazy.

1864
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:16,780
- Is that fun?
- No.

1865
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:17,864
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1866
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:23,119
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1867
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,080
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1868
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,712
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1869
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,965
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1870
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,050
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1871
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:38,134
Mark, you got...

1872
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,804
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1873
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:43,223
I want... I need you out here.

1874
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:45,225
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1875
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,394
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1876
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,229
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1877
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:51,231
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1878
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:52,399
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1879
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,651
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1880
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,236
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1881
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,737
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1882
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,406
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1883
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,992
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1884
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,326
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1885
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,161
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1886
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:09,165
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1887
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,959
And how's it going so far?

1888
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,924
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1889
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:24,014
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1890
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,599
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1891
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:29,144
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1892
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,648
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1893
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,698
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1894
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,199
No problem.

1895
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,287
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?

1896
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,122
That's comforting.

1897
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:52,292
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1898
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,046
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1899
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,882
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1900
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,884
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1901
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,014
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1902
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,643
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1903
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:13,730
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1904
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:15,899
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1905
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:18,902
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1906
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:21,321
Now, let me ask you something.

1907
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,406
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1908
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,011
Jesus Christ.

1909
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:49,683
When did you get back?

1910
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:51,184
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1911
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:53,186
When did you get back?

1912
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,939
I got back this afternoon.

1913
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,524
And when were you gonna call me?

1914
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:00,276
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1915
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:04,280
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1916
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:08,243
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behaviour.

1917
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,869
Are you mocking me?

1918
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:11,287
I brought you a present.

1919
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,959
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1920
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,127
What?

1921
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:21,131
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1922
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,882
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1923
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:25,051
And you just never bothered to change it?

1924
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,219
What?

1925
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:27,887
I don't know how.

1926
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,806
Do I look stupid to you?

1927
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:31,224
No, calm down.

1928
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,560
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1929
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,895
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1930
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,315
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1931
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:40,650
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1932
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:43,820
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1933
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:45,071
every time you go out to see Mark.

1934
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:48,158
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1935
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:51,161
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1936
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:52,662
Please, open your present.

1937
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:54,664
Your phone does work.

1938
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:56,750
It's Mark.

1939
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,002
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1940
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,588
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1941
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,339
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1942
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,592
This'll be your first.

1943
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:06,760
Yeah.

1944
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,094
<i>- You froze our account?</i>
- I did.

1945
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,430
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1946
01:36:10,514 --> 01:36:12,265
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1947
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:13,933
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1948
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,018
everything I've been working on?

1949
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,186
We have been working on.

1950
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:17,771
Without money, the site can't function.

1951
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:20,106
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1952
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,274
We don't crash ever!

1953
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:25,028
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1954
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,113
<i>- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

1955
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,949
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.</i>

1956
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,368
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1957
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,204
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1958
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,456
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1959
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,624
Don't you get that?

1960
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,334
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1961
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:42,712
Holy shit.

1962
01:36:45,549 --> 01:36:46,883
What is wrong with you?

1963
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:48,468
Did you like being nobody?

1964
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:50,303
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1965
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:51,805
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1966
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,223
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,</i>

1967
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,724
<i>and it certainly was not the act of a friend.</i>

1968
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,393
<i>You know how embarrassing it was</i>
for me to try to cash a check today?

1969
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,728
I am not going back to that life.

1970
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:01,231
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

1971
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:03,691
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1972
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,236
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1973
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,655
<i>because, Wardo, I've got some good news.</i>

1974
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:09,906
I'm sorry.

1975
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:14,744
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1976
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,664
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1977
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:19,082
What is it?

1978
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,751
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1979
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,002
What?

1980
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:27,173
<i>Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1981
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,426
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1982
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,011
They need your signature
on some documents,

1983
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:34,514
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1984
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:36,182
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1985
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:42,188
I'm on my way.

1986
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:43,773
- Wardo?
- Yeah?

1987
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,400
We did it.

1988
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:49,946
Wardo?

1989
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,448
You're going back there already?

1990
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:53,700
Yes.

1991
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:57,620
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

1992
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,251
Somebody stop her!

1993
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:06,796
Four documents.

1994
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:08,798
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

1995
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:11,968
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

1996
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:15,471
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

1997
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:16,723
The third is an exchange agreement

1998
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:19,559
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

1999
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:21,895
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2000
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,730
How many shares of stock will I own?

2001
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:26,983
1,328,334.

2002
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,443
Jesus Christ.

2003
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:31,446
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2004
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:34,282
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2005
01:38:34,366 --> 01:38:37,118
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2006
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:40,079
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2007
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,205
- Economics.
- Right.

2008
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:46,210
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2009
01:38:47,504 --> 01:38:50,757
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2010
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:55,136
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

2011
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:58,056
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2012
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:01,351
I can live with that.

2013
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,269
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2014
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,943
Would you like to use my pen?

2015
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,154
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2016
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,032
Can you please repeat the question?

2017
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,326
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2018
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,535
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2019
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,496
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2020
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,622
Well, go ahead.

2021
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:24,415
'And when you signed
these documents,

2022
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,251
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2023
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,419
No.

2024
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:36,970
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2025
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:40,223
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2026
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,061
I was your only friend.

2027
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,314
You had one friend.

2028
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,195
My father won't even look at me.

2029
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:59,367
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2030
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:02,495
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2031
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,039
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2032
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:08,251
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2033
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:11,087
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2034
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,131
And then before I left he said...

2035
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,298
But you gotta come back.

2036
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,884
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2037
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,429
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2038
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:21,264
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2039
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,640
A million members?

2040
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:23,891
Yeah.

2041
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:27,687
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2042
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:29,814
Yeah.

2043
01:40:33,235 --> 01:40:34,485
Yeah, I'll be here.

2044
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:40,825
You sure about this?

2045
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:42,076
You're 20 minutes late.

2046
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,619
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2047
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:44,829
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2048
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:47,081
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2049
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:48,750
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2050
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,501
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2051
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:53,629
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2052
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,131
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2053
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,341
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2054
01:40:57,426 --> 01:41:00,887
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2055
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,764
Walk out.

2056
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,057
Okay.

2057
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:19,030
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2058
01:41:19,114 --> 01:41:21,157
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2059
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:22,283
What else did the e-mail say?

2060
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:25,036
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2061
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:29,165
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2062
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:31,459
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2063
01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:35,463
<i>that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.</i>

2064
01:41:35,547 --> 01:41:39,717
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2065
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:43,513
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,</i>

2066
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,973
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2067
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:48,643
<i>- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?</i>

2068
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:50,937
<i>Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.</i>

2069
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:52,605
What were you called out there for?

2070
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:57,819
An ambush.

2071
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,071
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2072
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,246
Hey, man.

2073
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,372
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2074
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:12,166
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2075
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,711
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2076
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:21,884
But then I started reading.

2077
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,056
Wait, what is this?

2078
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,643
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2079
01:42:30,769 --> 01:42:31,811
What is this?

2080
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:45,575
Mr. Saverin.

2081
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:49,370
Mark!

2082
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,123
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2083
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:53,249
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2084
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:54,792
- Is he?
- Yes.

2085
01:42:56,378 --> 01:42:59,130
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2086
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:01,048
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2087
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:03,885
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2088
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:07,096
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2089
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:10,933
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2090
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,310
It wasn't.

2091
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:16,022
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2092
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:17,440
It wasn't.

2093
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:20,443
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2094
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:21,569
It wasn't.

2095
01:43:21,653 --> 01:43:24,322
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2096
01:43:24,406 --> 01:43:25,489
It wasn't.

2097
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:28,576
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2098
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:32,246
.03%

2099
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:42,381
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2100
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:45,009
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2101
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:46,969
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2102
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,679
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2103
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,097
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2104
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,224
You're not a part of Facebook.

2105
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,684
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2106
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:55,102
This because I froze the account?

2107
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:57,355
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2108
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:58,481
pretending you were running this company?

2109
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:00,900
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2110
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:05,363
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2111
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:07,114
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2112
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:10,117
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2113
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,328
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2114
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:19,210
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2115
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:21,420
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2116
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,465
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2117
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:26,259
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2118
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:29,762
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2119
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:33,057
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2120
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:37,687
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2121
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:47,113
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2122
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:50,366
Hang on.

2123
01:44:52,577 --> 01:44:54,161
Almost forgot.

2124
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:57,498
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2125
01:44:57,582 --> 01:44:59,125
I drew it on the account you froze.

2126
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,966
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2127
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:10,344
It makes me look so tough.

2128
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:24,775
Well...

2129
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:28,154
That's it,
that's our show for tonight, people.

2130
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:30,531
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2131
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:32,700
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2132
01:45:32,784 --> 01:45:35,911
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2133
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,042
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2134
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:43,753
You were kind of rough on him.

2135
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:45,838
That's life in the NFL.

2136
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:47,673
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2137
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:49,925
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2138
01:45:51,219 --> 01:45:53,304
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2139
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:54,597
He almost killed it.

2140
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,559
I'll send flowers.

2141
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:04,982
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2142
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:06,317
Ashleigh's a sister.

2143
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:07,943
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2144
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:11,197
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2145
01:46:11,823 --> 01:46:13,491
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2146
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:15,034
Well, a little bit.

2147
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:16,952
Why?

2148
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:18,871
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2149
01:46:18,955 --> 01:46:22,208
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2150
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:25,044
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2151
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:27,129
These came in for you.

2152
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,006
Put them on my desk.

2153
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,390
What's the package?

2154
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:39,308
Nothing.

2155
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:43,229
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2156
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:44,605
Refresh.

2157
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,315
Sweet!

2158
01:46:52,322 --> 01:46:54,365
And you're not a hugger.

2159
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:55,950
I know.

2160
01:46:58,578 --> 01:47:00,037
One million!

2161
01:47:01,623 --> 01:47:04,375
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2162
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:07,503
I've got champagne.

2163
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:30,943
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2164
01:47:31,027 --> 01:47:34,113
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2165
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:37,199
It is the true digitalization of real life.

2166
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:39,743
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2167
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:41,537
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2168
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:45,374
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2169
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:46,834
And tagging. The idea...

2170
01:47:46,918 --> 01:47:50,129
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2171
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,264
All right, shut the music down!

2172
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,266
The party's over!

2173
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:04,143
Everybody, go home!

2174
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,104
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2175
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:08,564
How they check their friends' status updates.

2176
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,149
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2177
01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:11,400
Check to see which one of their friends

2178
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,402
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2179
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,070
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2180
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:17,114
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2181
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:19,158
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2182
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:22,912
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2183
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:34,757
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2184
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:38,093
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2185
01:48:38,428 --> 01:48:40,262
Then it's all good.

2186
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:43,098
- It's the cops.
- What?

2187
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:44,225
Shit! Shit.

2188
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:48,062
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2189
01:48:48,605 --> 01:48:50,773
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2190
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:53,025
What's going on?

2191
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:55,694
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2192
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,321
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2193
01:48:57,405 --> 01:49:00,199
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2194
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,162
That's not mine.

2195
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:08,582
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2196
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:10,084
Oh, my God.

2197
01:49:10,168 --> 01:49:11,877
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2198
01:49:11,962 --> 01:49:13,003
No, sir. No.

2199
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,339
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2200
01:49:20,428 --> 01:49:21,929
What's this?

2201
01:49:22,138 --> 01:49:23,847
That's an EpiPen.

2202
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,268
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2203
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:29,770
How old are you?

2204
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:33,274
Twenty-one.

2205
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:34,775
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2206
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:36,527
Lying only makes it worse.

2207
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:40,406
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2208
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:52,459
Hello.

2209
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:55,045
Listen, something's happened.

2210
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:03,387
Shit.

2211
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:05,389
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2212
01:50:05,473 --> 01:50:09,476
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2213
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:15,316
Interns.

2214
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,234
It was just a party.

2215
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,407
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2216
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:25,659
I know.

2217
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:27,411
You know with an intern...

2218
01:50:27,495 --> 01:50:29,663
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2219
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,332
I will get it under control.

2220
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,792
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2221
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:35,419
But this is gonna be news now.

2222
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:38,672
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2223
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:39,798
I mean, do you think...

2224
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:40,966
No.

2225
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:43,052
Or Manningham. One of them.

2226
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:46,388
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2227
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,307
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2228
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:54,355
Right?

2229
01:50:57,108 --> 01:50:58,692
Go home, Sean.

2230
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,125
<i>Mark?</i>

2231
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:18,087
<i>Mark.</i>

2232
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,257
We're done for the day.

2233
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:24,927
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2234
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:30,516
What happened to Sean?

2235
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,268
He still owns 7% of the company.

2236
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,694
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2237
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:43,112
I can't.

2238
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:52,037
I'm not a bad guy.

2239
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,622
I know that.

2240
01:51:53,998 --> 01:51:57,501
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2241
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,086
And the other 15?

2242
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:02,297
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2243
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:07,302
What happens now?

2244
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:12,683
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2245
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:14,643
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2246
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:18,021
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2247
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:20,023
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2248
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:23,485
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2249
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,738
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2250
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:28,824
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2251
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:30,117
I invented Facebook.

2252
01:52:30,201 --> 01:52:32,327
I'm talking about a jury.

2253
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,164
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2254
01:52:35,248 --> 01:52:37,624
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2255
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:40,085
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2256
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,378
Likeability.

2257
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:44,339
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2258
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,799
and I could get a jury to believe

2259
01:52:45,884 --> 01:52:48,594
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2260
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:49,762
Watch what else.

2261
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:52,347
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2262
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:55,309
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2263
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:57,478
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2264
01:52:57,562 --> 01:52:59,688
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2265
01:53:01,357 --> 01:53:02,483
Farm animals.

2266
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:03,734
Yeah.

2267
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:07,279
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2268
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,615
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2269
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:12,075
Pay them.

2270
01:53:12,368 --> 01:53:13,577
In the scheme of things,

2271
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,370
it's a speeding ticket.

2272
01:53:17,373 --> 01:53:19,750
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2273
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,753
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2274
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,379
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2275
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,714
Thanks.

2276
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,884
I appreciate your help today.

2277
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,973
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2278
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:38,727
You're just trying so hard to be.
